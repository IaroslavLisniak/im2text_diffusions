# Basic Ideas

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use CLIP Interrogator \textit{https://github.com/pharmapsychotic/clip-interrogator}
  \item Try BLIP2 (it probably will not fit in CLIP Interrogator)
  \item Try different CLIPs for image encoding with Interrogator
  \item Try only BLIP 1/2 
  \item Try generation of images with promts and fine-tuning (where to find promts?)
  \item Think about promts generation. Find dataset, parse a bit or generate with decoder-only net
\end{itemize}
