# Basic Ideas

1. Use CLIP Interrogator \textit{https://github.com/pharmapsychotic/clip-interrogator}
2. Try BLIP2 (it probably will not fit in CLIP Interrogator)
3. Try different CLIPs for image encoding with Interrogator
4. Try only BLIP 1/2 
5. Try generation of images with promts and fine-tuning (where to find promts?)
6. Think about promts generation. Find dataset, parse a bit or generate with decoder-only net
